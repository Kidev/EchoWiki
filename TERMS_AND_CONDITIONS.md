# EchoWiki Terms and Conditions

**Last updated:** February 9, 2026

## 1. What EchoWiki Is

EchoWiki is a Reddit Devvit app that helps subreddit communities create wiki pages enriched with game assets. It provides a client-side tool for importing, extracting, and browsing game assets locally in your browser, and a wiki viewer that can display those assets inline.

## 2. Your Game Files, Your Responsibility

EchoWiki processes game files that **you** provide from **your own** local filesystem. By importing files into EchoWiki, you represent that:

- You legally own or have the right to access the game files you are importing.
- You are importing files for personal, non-commercial use within the context of this subreddit community tool.

EchoWiki does not upload, transmit, or distribute your game files. All processing and storage happens locally in your browser. The app is a viewer, not a distribution platform.

## 3. Game Asset Ownership and Distribution

**Game assets belong to their respective rights holders.** EchoWiki does not claim any ownership over any game assets you import or view through the app.

EchoWiki provides an `echo://` link system that allows wiki editors to reference locally-imported assets within wiki pages. These links resolve to assets stored in each individual user's own browser, they are **not** hosted URLs and cannot be used to distribute assets to anyone.

**You must not use EchoWiki to distribute, redistribute, or make available copyrighted game assets to others.** The app is designed so that each user imports their own copy of the game files. Wiki pages may reference assets by filename, but every user must have their own local copy for those references to resolve.

Subreddit moderators and wiki editors are responsible for ensuring that their wiki content complies with applicable copyright laws and the rights of game developers and publishers.

## 4. No Warranty

EchoWiki is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The developer does not guarantee that:

- The app will work with every game or engine version.
- Asset extraction will succeed for all supported formats.
- The app will be available or functional at all times.
- Stored assets will persist indefinitely (browser storage can be cleared by the browser, the user, or system policies).

## 5. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer of EchoWiki shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the app, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of access to game files, or any issues arising from the asset extraction process.

## 6. Moderator Responsibilities

Subreddit moderators who install and configure EchoWiki are responsible for:

- Setting appropriate game titles and configuration for their community.
- Ensuring wiki content created using EchoWiki's features complies with Reddit's rules and applicable laws.
- Understanding that configuration data (game title, style settings, filename mappings) is stored in Reddit's infrastructure for the subreddit and is accessible to the app.

## 7. Reddit Platform

EchoWiki runs on Reddit's Devvit platform and is subject to Reddit's own Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Developer Terms. Your use of Reddit's platform is governed by those agreements. In case of any conflict, Reddit's terms take precedence.

## 8. Data Handling

See the [PRIVACY_POLICY.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kidev/EchoWiki/refs/heads/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details on how EchoWiki handles data. In summary: no personal data is collected, no game files are uploaded, and subreddit configuration is stored only within Reddit's infrastructure.

## 9. Changes to These Terms

These terms may be updated from time to time. The updated version will be published in the app's repository with a new "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

## 10. Contact

If you have questions about these terms, you can open an issue on the app's repository or contact the developer through Reddit.
